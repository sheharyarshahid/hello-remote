# Hello Markdown! ![Image](https://commonmark.org/help/images/favicon.png "Markdown Logo")
## Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is popular on sites such as GitHub to create, among other things, README files

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it* you just:

* Remember the basic syntax!
* Write your doc
* Done!

Here you can write your own code in a code box like this: `console.writeline("Hello Markdown");`

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
